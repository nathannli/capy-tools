# Vendored diff subset

This directory vendors the ESM line-diff implementation from `diff@8.0.2` (`libesm/diff/base.js`, `libesm/diff/line.js`, and `libesm/util/params.js`).

It is bundled so `pi update git:github.com/capyup/pi-basic-tools` does not depend on `npm install` creating `node_modules/diff`.
